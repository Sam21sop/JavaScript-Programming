/* 
What is javascript

- Programming Language
- Scripting 
- enable to change conent dynamically
*/


/*
Javascript Statemenr are composed of 

1. values
2. operators
3. Expression 
4. Keywords
5. Comments
*/


/*
Javascript Comment

1. Single line comment ==> //
2. Multiline comment ==> /* *\/
*/


/*
Javascript Variables

variable are container to store data
1. var
2. let
3. const
4. atomatically
*/


/*
- let 

1. have block scope
2. you can declare it before used
3. can not be redeclared in the same scope
*/


/*
- const

1. con not redeclare
2. can not reassigned
3. have block scope
*/


/*
Javascript Operator

1. arithmetic (+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --)
2. assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=)
3. comparision (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
4. logical (&&, ||, !) 
5. bitwise (&, |, ~, ^, <<, >>, >>>)
6. ternary (?)
7. type (typeof, instanceof)
*/


/*
Javascript Data Types

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Object
7. Symbol
8. Bigint(rarely use case)
*/


/*
Javascript object

- object is collections of Properties
- property is association between key:value pair
- object can also have method
- Method are action that can be perform on object
*/


/*
Javascript String

- string are storing for text data type
- you can use single('') or double("") quotes to declare js string
- template string (``) backticks
- template string allow multiline strings
*/

/*
Javascript Array

- array is linear data strucutre which hold multiple data/value in single variable
- creating by using ==> [value1, value2,...]
- new Array(value1, value2, ...)
- array are special type of object 
*/


/*
Javascript Conditions

- perform different action based on condition
- if ==> block of code to be executed, if condition is true
- else ==> block of code to be executed, if same condition is false
- else if ==> specify new condition to test, if first condition is false
- switch  ==> specify many aleternative block of code to be executed
*/


/*
javascript loops

- block of code can be executed number of times.
- js support different kind of loop
1. for ==> number of time to execute block of code
2. for/in ==> loop through the properties of object
3. for/of ==> loop through the value of an iterable object
4. while ==> simple loop untile condition is true
5. do/while ==> 
*/


/*
Javascript Error

- try ==> statement define a code of block to run
- catch ==> statement define code a block to handle any error
- finally ==> statement define  code a block to run any how
- throw ==> define the custome error
*/



/*
Javascript Scope

- scope define the visibility of the variables
1. block scope ==> {} // you can not access the variables outside of the block
2. functional scope
    - eact function create new scope 
    - variables define inside a function can not accessible outside the fuction
    - functional scope also known as local scope
3. global scope
    - variable accessible from anywhere
*/


/*
Javascript this keyword

- thid keyword refers to an object
- alone, this refers to global object
- in an event, this refer to the element that recieved the event
- in function, in use strict mode this refers undefined
*/


/*
Javascript Fuctions

- Function block of code designed to perform a particular task again and again
- code reusablility
- DRY principal

- parameter listed inside the function defination
- arguments are actual values recieved by function when it id invoked

- arrow function
    - shorter syntaxt of function
    - arrow function return value by default
    - with the arrow function there is no binding of this keyword
*/


/*
Javascript Classes

- js classes are template for js object
- create a clsas using class keyword
- js class have constructor() method
- js class is not object

- constructor()
    - it is executed automatically when new object created
    - it is used to initialized object properties
    - if you don't define constructor method, js will automatically add an empty constructor method
